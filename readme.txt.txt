HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM
source code: scheduler.c scheduler.h, generator.c generator.h, queue.c queue.h
1)all source code must be in the same dicrectory
2)open terminal/visual studio code
3)type "make"
4)run program ./Scheduler task_file 50
note: "task_file" is the file that has tasks, name can be changed to any eg: helloworld, waitingtasks
      "50": number of task that will be generated in "task_file" and be executed in Scheduler, can be any number eg:10, 99, 192
       Scheduler: is the executable file that be named after "make", can not be changed because I named it as Scheduler in make file.
